<div class="title">Beginning a New Semester</div>
<div>This blog is mostly about my experiences as Computer Science student at FIT. Also, I will post any interesting projects that I do in classes on here if at all possible. If they are not web ready programs, such as a compiler,or a program in assembly language, I will post the source code and you may run it yourself. I am always open to critique on my projects and also ideas for anything that I could do differently.</div>
<div>As the fall semester of 2013 start I begin taking 6 new classes:</div>
<ul>
  <li>Software Engineering</li>
  <li>Computer Architecture and Assembly Language</li>
  <li>Advanced Java Concepts</li>
  <li>Applied Statistics</li>
  <li>Management Information Systems</li>
  <li>Research Sources and Systems</li>
</ul>

<div>Although I am tied for favorite between Software Engineering and Advanced Java Concepts. Software Engineering is a project based course that has the students take an existing program, such as computer game and then fix existing bugs. As my professor said "the easy part is fixing it, the hard part is not messing anything else up" (Dr. Gallagher). Software Engineering should prove to be a fun class, and I will post the bug fixes that I contribute to on here so that you can see them and may even be able to pick up a new program or game.</div>
<div>The other class, Advanced Java Concepts, with Dr. Stansifer, has peaked my interest because as he says we will be making programs that will produce things that look pretty. This class is focused mainly upon UI and then touches upon networks. I will include a link to his website that has the list of projects and when I can, I will post those projects on here.</div>

<div>Lastly, with a new semester comes new experiences. I have accepted a part-time job with the company that I interned for over the summer called Innovative Routines International. In this job I will be a programmer and I am finishing up a project that spilled over from my internship, but may be doing something different.</div>
<div>This semester looks promising since I am taking upper level classes and made it through the dreaded Algorithms and Data Structures over the summer.</div>
