<div class=title>Learn You Node JS</div> <div>I recently started branching out some more and trying to learn new technologies. After starting at Intuit, I felt like I should really start to commit to being a Web Developer. I keep feeling like I need to dive deeper. Considering Node.js is on their technology stack I decided I would jump into it and at least start with Learn You Node JS which I found through <a href=http://nodeschool.io/index.html>Nodeschool.io</a>. I completed the 13 lessons and have to say they go from basic to advanced very quickly. Let's dive a little deeper shall we?</div> <div>So a major feature of JS is callbacks. These are wonderful because you call your function and when the promise is returned it will call the callback function. In the first async lesson (Lesson 4) this is illustrated.</div> <div class=gist data-gistsrc=https://gist.github.com/zmchenry/69f7b2afcaf1c66ecf6f.js></div> <div>In the example above we read a file from a source and when that source is returned we call the callback function called readAsync. If there is not an error we go ahead and log the data that is returned.</div> <div>Another cool feature of NodeJS was it's ability to listen to a certain port and handle any data that is passed to it. By doing this we can just say "Hey I am going to pass some data at some point so if you could just handle it that would be great" This reminds me of actively reloading code to a browser.
