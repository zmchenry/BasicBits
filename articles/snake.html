<div class="title">Snakes Everywhere</div>
<div>This is a game of snake that I wrote for Software Development 2. It uses standard draw package from Java and has a basic splash screen. I do realize that there is a better way to draw the snake and update the screen but the assignment told us to use StdDraw. There are a few bugs, such as I cannot get it to register the keys Y or N when I would like to restart the game. After this semester with Advanced Java I think I will be able to make a better version. I may even try my had at a side scrolling shooter.</div>

<div>The Snake.java is the main file. If you would like to run this yourself you will need the StdDraw.java file found here: <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdDraw.java">StdDraw.java</a>. This is the apple file that controls all of the attributes of the apple, such as the amount of time the apple will stay in a position.</div>

<div>I am only going to post the collision detection in from my Snake game here but the rest of the project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/zmchenry/Snake">GitHub</a>. The collision detection works by looking at the position of the head and comparing it to the walls, the rest of the body, and the apples. To keep position I used an 2 arrays to keep the x and y positions of the body and then the apples have their own getter methods for getting their x and y position. To check the walls, I compared the position of the head to the amount of pixels that the wall would take up.</div>

<div>I do not own the rights to StdDraw and I did not create StdDraw that was created by Sedgewick for his Algorithms book and his Introduction to Java Fundamentals book.</div>
